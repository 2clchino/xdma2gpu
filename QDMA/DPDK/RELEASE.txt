Release: 2019.1
===============

This release is based on DPDK v18.11 containing QDMA poll mode driver and
QDMA test application. This release is validated on QDMA 2019.1 design.

This release includes a patch file for dpdk-pktgen v3.6.1 that extends
dpdk-pktgen application to handle packets with packet sizes more than 1518 bytes
and it disables the packet size classification logic in dpdk-pktgen to remove
application overhead in performance measurement.
This patch is used for performance testing with dpdk-pktgen application.

The driver is validated against dpdk-pktgen and testpmd applications for API compliance.

SUPPORTED FEATURES:
===================
2018.2 Features
---------------
- Support for both the AXI4 Memory Mapped(MM) and AXI4 Streaming(ST) Interfaces
- 2048 Queue Sets
	- 2048 H2C Descriptor Rings
	- 2048 C2H Descriptor Rings
	- 2048 C2H Completion Rings
- Supports Polling Mode
- Supports SR-IOV with 4 Physical Functions(PF) and 252 Virtual Functions(VF)
- Allows Only Privileged/Physical functions to program the contexts and registers
- Mailbox Support
- Supports Descriptor Prefetch
- ST H2C to C2H and C2H to H2C loopback support
- Zero-byte transfer support

2018.3 Features
---------------
- Descriptor (8, 16, 32, 64 bytes) bypass support
- Support for Completion queue descriptors of 64 bytes size
- Support flexible BAR mapping for QDMA configuration register space
- Support disabling overflow check in completion ring
- Indirect programming of FMAP registers
- Version for SW and HW

2019.1 Features
---------------
- Support DPDK v18.11 LTS
- Interrupt support for Mailbox events
- Support Completions in Memory mapped mode
- Interoperability between Linux driver (as PF/VF) and DPDK driver (as PF/VF)
- Error monitoring and error logging
- Driver restructuring to partition QDMA access code such that it can be used across different drivers
- Device configuration through additional driver APIs

KNOWN BUGS:
===========
- Sometimes completions are not received when C2H PIDX updates are held for 64 descriptors
- dma_from_device command in qdma_testapp application requests more data from user logic than specified

LIMITATIONS:
===========
- Big endian systems are not supported
- All VFs created by a PF should be shut down before terminating the parent PF. This is needed as all the QDMA VF configuration is through this parent PF.
- For optimal QDMA streaming performance, packet buffers of the descriptor ring should be aligned to at least 256 bytes.
