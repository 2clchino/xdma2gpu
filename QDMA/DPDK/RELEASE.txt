Release: 2018.3
===============

This release is based on DPDK v17.11.1 containing QDMA poll mode driver and
QDMA test application.

This release includes a patch file for dpdk-pktgen v3.4.7 that extends
dpdk-pktgen application to handle packets with packet sizes more than 1518 bytes
and it disables the packet size classification logic in dpdk-pktgen to remove
application overhead in performance measurement.
This patch is used for performance testing with dpdk-pktgen application.

The driver is validated against dpdk-pktgen and testpmd applications for API compliance.
2018.3 driver is not backward compatible with 2018.2 and earlier QDMA IP.
