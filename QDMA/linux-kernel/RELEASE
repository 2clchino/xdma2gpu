2018.3 Features
---------------
- Auto mode support for PF & VF driver
	- MM and ST H2C requests are services in poll mode
	- ST C2H is services in Interrupt Aggregation mode
- Support 64B descriptor format in bypass mode
- Support for Completion queue descriptors of 64 bytes size
- Support flexible BAR mapping for QDMA configuration register space
- Indirect programming of FMAP registers
- Support disabling overflow check in completion ring
- Version for SW and HW
- ECC Support
- Flexible interrupt allocation between PF/VF
- Greater than 32 vectors per function
- Legacy Interrupt Support
- VF driver support in direct and indirect interrupt mode

2019.1 Features
---------------
- Interrupt support for Mailbox events
- Support Completions in Memory mapped mode
- Interoperability between Linux driver (as PF/VF) and DPDK driver (as PF/VF)
- Driver restructuring to partition QDMA access code such that it can be used across different drivers

2019.1 Patch Updates
--------------------
- Addressed the issues observed in static analysis of the code base
- Added the User Logic pluggability
- Supported HW Error detection in poll mode


KNOWN ISSUES:
=============
- Sometimes completions are not received when C2H PIDX updates are held for 64 descriptors
- FLR Reset on a PF while any VFs are attached to PF is not working

DRIVER LIMITATIONS:
===================
- Driver compilation on Fedora 28 with gcc8.1 results compilation warnings
- Big endian systems are not supported
- All VFs created by a PF should be shut down before terminating the parent PF. This is needed as all the QDMA VF configuration is through this parent PF.
- For optimal QDMA streaming performance, packet buffers of the descriptor ring should be aligned to at least 256 bytes.
